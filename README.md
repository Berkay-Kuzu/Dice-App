# Dicee-App
This is a dice app that we can change the dices by pressing button. Thus, this is an app which has behaviour and functionality. I linked the images and button to ViewController by using IBActions and IBOutlets. I also benefited from Swift constants, variables, and arrays. Arrays in this app are crucial in order to use the dice images. In addition, I used randomisation to generate random numbers in the app. In connection with this, I benefited from array index and the range operators as well.
