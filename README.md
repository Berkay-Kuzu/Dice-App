# Dicee-App
This is a dice app that we can change the dices in a random manner by pressing button . Thus, this is an app which has behaviour and functionality. I linked the images and button to ViewController by using IBActions and IBOutlets. I also benefited from Swift constants, variables, and arrays. Arrays in this app are crucial in order to use the dice images. In addition, I used randomisation to generate random dice images in the app. In connection with this, I benefited from array index and the range operators as well. Together with Dicee app, you will always carry you dices in your pocket and whenever you want, you can use them!
